Watching a video and using other learning resources at the same time
is distracting and complicated by the need to switch between two
windows.  If you are watching a movie then rememebering key points can
be difficult without taking notes.  However, taking notes can prevent
from watching the movie and viewing key points.
*** Solution
Now a person can create a video that has addition slides containing key points which 
appear in the video for the viewer.
